### Text
All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.

Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.

### Notice

A notice displays information that explains nearby content. Often used to call attention to a particular detail.

When using Kramdown `{: .notice}` can be added after a sentence to assign the `.notice` to the `<p></p>` element. 

**Changes in Service:** We just updated our [privacy policy](#) here to better service our customers. We recommend reviewing the changes.
{: .notice}

**Primary Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. [Praesent libero](#). Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--primary}

**Info Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [consectetur adipiscing elit](#). Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--info}

**Warning Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. [Integer nec odio](#). Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--warning}

**Danger Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [consectetur adipiscing](#) elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at nibh elementum imperdiet.
{: .notice--danger}

**Success Notice:** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer nec odio. Praesent libero. Sed cursus ante dapibus diam. Sed nisi. Nulla quis sem at [nibh elementum](#) imperdiet.
{: .notice--success}

Want to wrap several paragraphs or other elements in a notice? Using Liquid to capture the content and then filter it with `markdownify` is a good way to go.

```html
{% raw %}{% capture notice-2 %}
#### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}{% endraw %}

<div class="notice">{% raw %}{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}{% endraw %}</div>
```

{% capture notice-2 %}
#### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-2 | markdownify }}
</div>

Or you could skip the capture and stick with straight HTML.

```html
<div class="notice">
  <h4>Message</h4>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>
```

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Message</h4>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>

### Figure



The preferred way of using images is placing them in the `/assets/images/` directory and referencing them with an absolute path. Prepending the filename with `{% raw %}{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/{% endraw %}` will make sure your images display properly in feeds and such.

Standard image with no width modifier classes applied.

**HTML:**

```html
{% raw %}<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg" alt="">{% endraw %}
```

**or Kramdown:**

```markdown
{% raw %}![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg){% endraw %}
```

![Unsplash image 9]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/unsplash-image-9.jpg)

Image that fills page content container by adding the `.full` class with:

**HTML:**

```html
{% raw %}<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg" alt="" class="full">{% endraw %}
```

**or Kramdown:**

```markdown
{% raw %}![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg)
{: .full}{% endraw %}
```

![Unsplash image 10]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/unsplash-image-10.jpg)
{: .full}

#### image type:
image link:

[![foo](https://live.staticflickr.com/8361/8400335147_5fabaa504c_o.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/dNiUYB)

image caption:

{% capture fig_img %}
![Foo]({{ '/assets/images/unsplash-gallery-image-3.jpg' | relative_url }})
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_img | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
  <figcaption>Photo from Unsplash.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### image align:

The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg){: .align-center}

The image above happens to be **centered**.

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg)

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg){: .align-right}

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The figure above happens to be **centered**. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.

<figure style="width: 150px" class="align-left">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Itty-bitty caption.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

<figure style="width: 1200px">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Massive image comment for your eyeballs.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The figure element above has an inline style of `width: 1200px` set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.

<figure style="width: 300px" class="align-right">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Feels good to be right all the time.</figcaption>
</figure> 

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And that's a wrap, yo! You survived the tumultuous waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked!
