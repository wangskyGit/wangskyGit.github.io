Based on my previous work, I conclude some important methdos in GNN, especially heterogeneous ones. You can refer to this [ppt](https://wangskygit.github.io/assets/pdf/convGNN.pdf) for more information; 

It is based on several survey and more recent papers. If you wana to use it, please cite my name and my personal site. 

本人才疏学浅，如有任何问题，欢迎批评指正. I am not learned, if there are any problems, welcome to criticize the correction!
